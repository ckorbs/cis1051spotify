# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

My favorite Artist

TODO

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Create an application that lets someone enter an artist of choice and recieve a report consisting of information about the artist, song recommendations, and similar artists using Spotify's API.

TODO

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The software will present information based on the artist entered. It will extract data from Wikipedia/another source and Spotify to present recommended songs and more to the user. The data will be presented as an email with a paragraph about the artist and an attactched playlist of songs.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Ideally, I will have something that will present song recommendations by the artist entered.

TODO

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome will also include similar artists and song recommendations by those other artists.

TODO

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome provides the artist background and a playlist of their song recs, & similar artist and song recs

TODO

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Need to create a spotify for developers account to gain access to a client ID to be able to access the spotify API and figure out if I am creating an app or if I can do it directly into spotiy.
